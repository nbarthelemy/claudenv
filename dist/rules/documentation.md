# Documentation Rules

**Automatic:** Update docs with every code change. No asking, no skipping.

## What to Update

- **Inline:** Docstrings, comments for non-obvious logic
- **File-level:** Header comments, imports/exports
- **Project:** README.md, CLAUDE.md, command/skill files
- **Release:** Changelog entries

## Skip

Obvious code, debug code, self-explanatory names
